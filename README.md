The dashboard aims to provide business leaders with valuable insights into areas for improvement.

For this project, I analyzed customer reviews of British Airways flights from March 2016 to October 2023. 

The data is stored in a CSV file named “ba_reviews”. 

Additionally, I utilized a mapping table called “Countries”, which includes fields such as country codes to support the analysis.
