The objective of this project was to develop an interactive Tableau dashboard showcasing airline ratings across various metrics. The dashboard aims to provide business leaders with valuable insights into areas for improvement.

For this project, I analyzed customer reviews of British Airways flights from March 2016 to October 2023. The data is stored in a CSV file named “ba_reviews”. Additionally, I utilized a mapping table called “Countries”, which includes fields such as country codes to support the analysis.
